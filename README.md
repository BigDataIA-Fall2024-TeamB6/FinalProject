# Outlook Assistant

## Overview
The Outlook Email Management Assistant enables users to efficiently manage their inboxes by leveraging OpenAI, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), natural language processing, and automation to streamline email management. It focuses on simplifying email management with features like query-based email interaction, email summarization, categorization, automatic responses to the emails, real-time translation, and audio transcription for accessibility. By automating these tasks, this tool will help users save time, improve productivity, reduce email overload, and ensure they never miss crucial communications, all while enhancing accessibility for users with different needs.

## Problem Statement
Managing an email inbox has become increasingly difficult due to the overwhelming volume of emails many users receive daily, leading to challenges in prioritizing and responding to important messages. Important emails can easily get lost in the clutter, and manual efforts to sort, prioritize, and respond to emails take up valuable time. Additionally, emails may be missed if they end up in junk folders, or users might overlook key information in long threads. For individuals with accessibility needs, reading and processing email content can also pose challenges. These issues highlight the need for an intelligent, automated system that can help users manage their inboxes more efficiently, prioritize critical communications, and improve accessibility.
Key Challenges:

The project aims to develop an Outlook Email Management Assistant that uses Microsoft Graph API, AI, and automation to simplify and enhance email management within Outlook. The core functionalities include enabling users to interact with their inbox using natural language queries, automating tasks like email summarization, and categorization, and providing accessibility features such as audio transcription. The tool will focus on improving email organization, productivity, and accessibility within the Outlook ecosystem. The project will deliver a user-friendly application for efficient email management, without extending to other email platforms or advanced custom machine learning algorithms.
