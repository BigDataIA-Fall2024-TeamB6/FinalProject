# FinalProject


## Outlook Email Management Assistant
The goal of this project is to develop an Outlook Email Management Assistant that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), AI, natural language processing, and automation to streamline email management. The assistant will enable users to efficiently manage their inbox by providing features such as query-based email interaction, automatic email summarization, real-time translation, and audio transcription for accessibility. It will also categorize emails intelligently and retrieve important messages that may be missed. By automating these tasks, this tool will help users save time, improve productivity, reduce email overload, and ensure they never miss crucial communications, all while enhancing accessibility for users with different needs.

## Problem Statement
Managing an email inbox has become increasingly difficult due to the overwhelming volume of emails many users receive daily, leading to challenges in prioritizing and responding to important messages. Important emails can easily get lost in the clutter, and manual efforts to sort, prioritize, and respond to emails take up valuable time. Additionally, emails may be missed if they end up in junk folders, or users might overlook key information in long threads. For individuals with accessibility needs, reading and processing email content can also pose challenges. These issues highlight the need for an intelligent, automated system that can help users manage their inbox more efficiently, prioritize critical communications, and improve accessibility.
Key Challenges:
Email Overload: Large volumes of emails can overwhelm users, making it difficult to prioritize and manage communications.
Time Inefficiency: Manually categorizing and responding to emails takes significant time, especially with routine emails.
Lack of Accessibility: Users with disabilities or those who prefer auditory processing struggle to read and process emails.
Missed Important Emails: Important emails, such as job interview invitations or time-sensitive job application responses, can easily be overlooked, especially if they end up in the spam or junk folder.
Delayed Responses: When emails like job applications or interviews require quick responses, users may miss deadlines due to missed notifications or mismanagement.

The project aims to develop an Outlook Email Management Assistant that uses Microsoft Graph API, AI, and automation to simplify and enhance email management within Outlook. The core functionalities include enabling users to interact with their inbox using natural language queries, automating tasks like email summarization, categorization, and providing accessibility features such as audio transcription. The tool will focus on improving email organization, productivity, and accessibility within the Outlook ecosystem. The project will deliver a user-friendly application for efficient email management, without extending to other email platforms or advanced custom machine learning algorithms.
